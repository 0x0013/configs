### Custom Configs FTW!!

Here are the configurations I use for my dev setups.
The Installation instructions are for *MacOS* as of yet.

#### NeoVim
I use NeoVim, because, well... I use a Mac
- `$ brew install neovim`

The configuration file is `init.vim` located in `~/.config/nvim/`

#### tmux
I use Tmux for window management
- `$ brew install tmux`

The configuration file is `.tmux.conf`

#### zsh
I use zsh as my bash prompt...
It is installed by default on modern versions of *MacOS*

This configuration file is `.zshrc`

### MISC
- I use Fira Code font (Fira Code, Retina, 14pts)
- I use iTerm2 as Terminal.app on MacOS doesn't support truecoloring as of yet
