### Custom Configs FTW!!

Here are the configurations I use for my dev setups.
The Installation instructions are for *MacOS* as of yet.

#### Vim
I use MacVim, because, well... I use a Mac
- `$ brew install macvim`

The configuration file is `.vimrc`

#### tmux
I use Tmux for window management
- `$ brew install tmux`

The configuration file is `.tmux.conf`

#### zsh
I use zsh as my bash prompt...
It is installed by default on modern versions of *MacOS*

This configuration file is `.zshrc`

### MISC
- I use Fira Code font (Fira Code, Retina, 14pts)
